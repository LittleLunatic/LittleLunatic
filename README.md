Hi. I'm Techiesplash.

I am a hobbyist who has been learning a mix of C#, C++, and C for a while now.
I've now gotten to the point where I can start making stuff.

I have benn programming on older systems, such as the Sega Genesis (Mega Drive), the Nintendo 3DS, and the Nintendo 64.
The technical limitations helped me write more efficient and effective code.

Now, I have started working on things for the modern computer. 

Let's see where it goes...
